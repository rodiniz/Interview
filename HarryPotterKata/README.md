Harry Potter Kata
===============================

You would like to buy the famous Harry Potter books but you have little money in your pocket 
so you would like to write a program to help you estimate the total cost of your purchase.

The rules are:

- A book costs 8 euros
- There are 5 different volumes
- To get a discount, you must buy books of different volumes:
	* Buying 1 book doesn't give you a discount
	* Buying 2 books applies a 5% discount
	* Buying 3 books applies a 10% discount
	* Buying 4 books applies a 15% discount
	* Buying 5 books applies a 20% discount
	
Examples:

	Given a basket
	When I buy 2 books of volume 1
	Then the total is 16 euros	

	Given a basket
	When I buy 1 book of volume 1
	And I buy 1 book of volume 2
	Then the total is 15.2 euros
